The game
A player can choose a slapable card and by pressing, longer for more intensity to a certain limit, it registers a slap on that card by that player.
Theres a list of rankings of most slapped cards world wide and per country.
Cards are created from a json file (later an api).

The player
Any person can play the game on a mobile or a desktop or tablet if it supports a browser. 
All players are anonymous but there is a session locally stored to track the person in the game.

The card
Should be like a magic gathering cards, with a top image, name, description and listed properties bellow with values.

The slap
This is a crucial experience that needs to be done with a simple press, that is longer or shorter depending on the intensity. It should have a visual ui feeling of pulling back while pressing and slaping on letting go, with a small reaction on the card.
Each slap increases a count on the slap. It must also log the request attached to the slap.

The main user journey
The player enters the game, sees a clickable map of the world. On the top left theres a dropdown with all the countries. On the top right it should have an automatically created name for the player.
The player clicks on a country on the map, or choses a country from the dropdown, and from the rightside slides in a drawer with a grid of cards for that country. On top of the grid there a simple keyword search and a sort dropdown.
